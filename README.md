### API Middleware Setup
This is a .NET Web API that is not hosted (yet) and can only be ran locally

To run:
  1. Clone Repo and navigate into /CoastyAPI/CoastyApi
  2. To build and launch use terminal command: dotnet run --launch-profile https
  3. Start up a live server from  the home.html file in vscode.
  4. Can be accessed by clicking into the localhost shown in your terminal and adding /swagger to the end of the URL
      -> 'https://localhost:7108/swagger'

### Note on news page:
This page works best if you search for articles three weeks in the past in prominent cities like New Orleans. Searching for something like "flood" will usually populate the articles returned.

### Notes on late commits
Huston had to push his model to the github for credit reasons and small changes to the readme were added. None of these changes affected or added to the functionality of the project, they were simply for ease of grading and website usage understanding for the graders.
